Atari_DQN

An implementation of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for playing Atari 2600 games using PyTorch. This project is inspired by the seminal work of Mnih et al. in “Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning”. ￼

Overview

This repository provides a PyTorch-based implementation of the DQN algorithm applied to various Atari games. The agent learns to play games directly from raw pixel inputs, utilizing techniques such as experience replay and target networks to stabilize training.
